                        Ben loves music, whether playing piano or listening to albums. When he's not indulging in his favorite snack, chocolate digestives, he is a skilled programmer. He works as a software developer for a game design company while studying at TUD Tallaght and prefers backend to frontend. "It's a real knife fight out here, folks."
