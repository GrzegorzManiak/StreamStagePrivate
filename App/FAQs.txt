Q: What is a "Stream" ticket?
A: "Stream" tickets entitle you to watch one showing of a stream of an event at the time 
of the showing. You will also have a permanent video of the event on your "Past" events page.

Q: What is the difference between "Stream" tickets and other tickets?
A: "Stream" tickets allow you to watch a stream of the event on the platform. All other 
tickets are "in-person" tickets which will give you admission to the live show at the 
venue. Both tickets will allow you to watch the stream of the event (once all showings 
of the event have concluded) on your "Past" events page.

Q: What are the benefits of buying a subscription to StreamStage?
A: A subscription allows you access to all tickets events earlier than a regular account. 
You will get a 10% discount on all ticket purchases (once the broadcaster has opted in). 
You can also watch all event streams 7 days after the last showing of the event, with a 
permanent video of all events available on your "Past" events page.

Q: Can I watch an event if I missed the live showings?
A: Yes, but only the video. If you have purchased an in-person ticket, you have missed 
the live event. If you have bought a ticket to an event, you can watch the video of it 
(once all showings of the event have concluded) on your "Past" events page. If you have 
a subscription, all event streams will be available here 7 days after the last showing 
of the event. 

***Refunds & Rescheduled/Cancelled Events***

Q: My event has been rescheduled – will I get new tickets?
A: If tickets have already been sent out when the event has been rescheduled, they'll 
usually be valid for the new date. There's a small possibility that the original tickets 
won't be accepted, but we'll always be sure to let you know if that's the case. 

Q: What is the refund policy for ticket purchases?
A: All payments are final, except in cases of cancelled events. We can’t offer any 
exchanges or refunds if your event is going ahead on the date originally planned. 
The good news is you have a permanent video of the event on your "Past" events page.

Q: What is the refund policy for subscriptions?
A: All payments are final, no refunds are available for subscription payments,
except in cases of legally proven fraud.
